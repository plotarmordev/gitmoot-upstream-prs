	EscalationNotifier EscalationNotifier
	// EventSink is the injected, best-effort outbound event seam (#446), mirroring
	// EscalationNotifier: when configured, the engine emits a redacted, versioned
	// events.Event on each terminal transition it owns (job.finished on a
	// succeeded terminal, job.needs_attention on an escalate_human pause) so an
	// off-box consumer (a webhook) can observe the run. It is optional and
	// nil-safe: when nil (the default, no [events] config) NO event is constructed
	// or emitted and behavior is byte-identical. Emit is fire-and-forget and best-
	// effort — a slow/hung/erroring sink never blocks or fails a job (see
	// internal/events). The daemon emits the failure/blocked/awaiting-human
	// terminal cases it owns through the SAME sink so the whole terminal set is

	// re-queues the job behind a classified operational blocker (runtime auth/quota/
	// network), Run reports ErrJobDeferred and never emits job.failed, so the
	// [events] stream sees the deferral as a first-class transition instead of a
	// failed→deferred flap. It mirrors EventSink: optional and nil-safe (when nil —
	// foreground/ask paths and every non-daemon construction — Run is byte-identical),
	// and best-effort (a deferrer error is treated as "not deferred" so the job takes
	// its normal terminal path). The concrete impl lives in cli (it classifies with

	// NO review leg runs and NO review row is written, so behavior is
	// byte-identical), and best-effort (a dispatch error is swallowed and recorded

	// block or fail a job). It runs OFF the blocking merge path. The concrete impl

	// complexity tools + a pure-Go diff-size metric) whose tool-derived dimensions
	// are projected into the SAME auto-trace run as a THIRD coexisting signal,

// validateDelegationAuthorityCeiling is the CRB-16 fix: an in-code authority

// target-shaped (does the named agent exist / is it on this repo / does it
// have the requested capability, or is the ephemeral spec well-formed) —
// nothing checked the REQUESTER's own authority, so a read-only seat could
// return a delegations[] entry naming an implement-capable agent, or an
// ephemeral spec carrying a writable autonomy policy, and the daemon would
// materialize it: a read-only reviewer using the very channel meant for
// read-only fan-out to obtain unrestricted write access. Because review/ask
// prompts routinely quote untrusted repository content, this is not merely a
// confused-model bug but a realistic prompt-injection escape hatch — the
// risk this ceiling closes.
//
// The discriminator is the PARENT'S OWN AGENT REGISTRATION (the agents table
// row named by parent.Agent — its capabilities_json, loaded here via
// Store.GetAgent), not the parent job's Type. A prior attempt at this fix
// gated on job Type (ask/review vs. implement) and was rejected: production
// coordinators legitimately run AS ask-type jobs while their registered
// agent carries "implement" in its own capability set (e.g. a coordinator
// agent registered ["ask","review","implement"] that reaches its implement
// fan-out phase while the driving job is still typed "ask") — gating on job
// Type broke that primary flow. Gating on the agent's registered
// capabilities instead is authoritative in both directions: it keeps that
// production coordinator's implement delegations working (its AGENT has
// "implement", regardless of the current job's Type), and it still denies a
// read-only reviewer seat registered WITHOUT "implement" (e.g.
// ["ask","review"] or ["ask"]), regardless of what job Type that seat
// happens to be running as.
//
// The rule is deliberately narrow and additive, matching the operator's
// CRB-16 scope ruling (no DelegationGrant table, no persistence — an
// in-code ceiling at the validation seam that reuses the existing agents
// table):
//
//   - A parent whose own registered agent does NOT have "implement" in its
//     capabilities may not delegate a child whose action is "implement"
//     (named agent OR ephemeral spec — the action check is shape-independent).
//   - Such a parent may also not delegate an EPHEMERAL child carrying an
//     autonomy policy that grants write (workspace-write or
//     danger-full-access, see runtime.PolicyGrantsImplementWrite), even when
//     that child's declared action is itself ask/review. This closes the
//     second escalation path CRB-16 documents: a nominally read-only
//     ephemeral worker bootstrapped with a writable policy still has
//     Bash/file-write access regardless of what "action" label it was
//     given, because the daemon's write-policy guard elsewhere is
//     implement-specific and never inspected here.
//   - A parent whose registered agent already has "implement" is
//     unaffected: it keeps its existing ability to delegate
//     implement/writable-ephemeral children, exactly matching the
//     council-lead-codex production pattern (ask-type job, implement-capable
//     agent, implement child).
//
// A named (non-ephemeral) delegation's target agent capabilities were fixed
// at operator registration time (UpsertAgent), not chosen by the untrusted
// parent output, so the existing target-only capability check already
// covers "is this agent allowed to implement at all" — this ceiling adds
// the missing question, "may THIS parent's agent hand out that capability".
//
// Only "implement" and write-granting-ephemeral delegations reach the
// Store.GetAgent lookup below: ask/review delegations (the overwhelming
// majority of the suite, and of production ask/review fan-out) are
// unaffected and incur no extra lookup, matching the product's existing
// design where ask/review is the safe, non-escalating default and
// "implement" is the one gated capability.
